<p>It’s easy to say that a story should speak for itself, though what do you do if it speaks ancient Greek? How can you make it readable by everyone without boring or insulting anyone?</p>

<p>The first thing I tried was to keep that Greek to what I hoped was a minimum, with the goal of using it as seasoning, not the main ingredient.</p>

<p> Then, for (everyone’s) sanity, I avoided the Greek alphabet entirely, rendering words into our Latin alphabet (or, technically, the Latin <i>abecedarium</i>, if we’re going to be pedantic — and we most certainly are). For this task, I chose polytonic transliteration.</p>

<p>Finally, as an act of mercy — and for reasons that make internal sense — the Greek itself takes advantage of such seemingly anachronistic innovations as mixed-case letters, punctuation marks, and spaces between words.</p>

<p>The intention was to create text that would make sense to people whose only language was English. I thought it would help that many of these Greek words — such as <i><a href="https://glossary.igorevans.com/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary-aura.html">áura</a>, <a href="https://glossary.igorevans.com/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary-miasma.html">míasma</a>, </i>and <i><a href="https://glossary.igorevans.com/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary-plethora.html">plēthṓra</a> — </i>are immediately identifiable with their English cognates.</p>

<p>Still, since not all terms are this obvious, I tried to make their meaning clear in context and also linked them to an extensive glossary written by <i><a href="https://glossary.igorevans.com/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary-miklos.html">Míklos</a> </i>in his usual, objective way.</p>

<p>I applied all of these strategies and thought that it would be enough to make the multilingual text palatable. I really did. However, I was wrong. I know because that’s the clear feedback I received from readers who were overwhelmed by it.</p>

<p>It seems that the bit of Greek that I picked up along the way had skewed my perceptions, leading me to harbor unrealistic expectations about how understandable it was to monolingual English speakers. Perhaps more fundamentally, I underestimated how distracting and annoying the intrusion of Greek would feel. All this is likely made worse by the fact that <i><a href="https://glossary.igorevans.com/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary-miklos.html">Míklos</a> </i> does not speak English as his first language and therefore talks funny (unlike me).</p>

<p>As much as I convinced myself that I was only using Greek as seasoning, it became clear that the resulting dish was so overseasoned as to have become unpalatable. It seemed a shame to me for a literary conceit be allowed to discourage some  readers from getting to the end. And so I grabbed my editing scythe (all writers have one; trust me on this) and tore out as much Greek as I could, resulting in the what you have in front of you: what I’ve called the English edition of the book.</p>

<p>There’s still quite a bit of Greek left, though much less than originally. And what remains is used more strategically, hopefully aiding the story instead of distracting from it. That’s something for you to judge, though.</p>

<p>Now there’s a core set of Greek words used throughout to refer to concepts central to the setting, and often without parallel in our world. In the italicized interludes, which lean toward world-building and aren’t central to the plot, the Greek is more likely to be preserved. Overall, though, terms that added flavor without being essential have mostly been cut: replaced by English equivalents while retaining only the hyperlinks to the external glossary.</p>

<p>While no longer essential, that glossary still has some value. It contains (supposedly) amusing, informative, and even educational tidbits strewn throughout. It’s also safe to read at any point, as there are no spoilers.</p>

<p>Any additional insights offered into the <a href="https://glossary.igorevans.com/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary-xiphos.html">sword</a>-<a href="https://glossary.igorevans.com/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary-kai.html">and</a>-<a href="https://glossary.igorevans.com/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary-sandalion.html">sandal</a> <i><a href="https://glossary.igorevans.com/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary-miklos.html">Míklos</a> </i> <a href="https://glossary.igorevans.com/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary-phantasia.html">Cinematic</a> <a href="https://glossary.igorevans.com/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary-kosmos.html">Universe</a> (or is it the <i><a href="https://glossary.igorevans.com/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary-miklos.html">Míklos</a>-</i><a href="https://glossary.igorevans.com/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary-doulos.html">Industrial</a> <a href="https://glossary.igorevans.com/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary-the.html">Complex</a>?) are provided solely in the interest of completeness. And contrary to the rumors I’ve spread, no legitimate university will reward you with credit toward a Classics degree just for reading it. Sorry, not sorry.</p>

<p>Still, you might want to check out the entry on <a href="https://glossary.igorevans.com/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary-orthographia.html">orthography</a>, since it explains how italics and the various quotation marks are used. You should also know that there’s a full index at the <a href="https://glossary.igorevans.com/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary.xhtml#top">top</a>, as well as a long-winded and likely insulting <a href="section-glossary.xhtml#top">rant</a> by <i><a href="https://glossary.igorevans.com/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary-miklos.html">Míklos</a> </i>about the objectivity and accuracy of the glossary as well as the purity and superiority of his particular dialect of Greek.</p>

<p>This is perhaps to be expected because, on many topics, <i><a href="https://glossary.igorevans.com/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary-miklos.html">Míklos</a> </i> has strong, bigoted opinions that are offensively wrong. I think it’s fair to say that his Greco-supremacist ideology would have made ultranationalist dictator General <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgios_Papadopoulos">Georgios Papadopoulos</a> blush and ask him to maybe tone it down a bit.</p>

<p>Likewise, his culturally appropriate misogyny rivals that of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Sim#Views_on_women">Dave Sim</a>. He also likes fire just a bit too much, and don’t even get me started on slavery, not that <i><a href="https://glossary.igorevans.com/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary-miklos.html">Míklos</a> </i> will ever shut up about it. Or anything else, really: he just goes on and on (unlike me).</p>

<p>And on that note, that’s all I’ve got to say for now. The book’s yours, so read it any way you want to or stop if you don’t. I tried to strike a balance that works for as many people as possible, though if that doesn’t include you, no hard feelings. After all, <i><a href="https://glossary.igorevans.com/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary-miklos.html">Míklos</a> </i>is nothing if not polarizing.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, read on<i>!</i></p>
