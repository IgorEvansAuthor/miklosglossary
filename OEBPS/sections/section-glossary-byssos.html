Literally, “byssus”, through <a href="https://glossary.igorevans.com/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary.xhtml#xenos">foreign</a> influence. A fine, yellowish-white linen prized for its exceptional delicacy and sheen. It is lightweight, almost sheer, and has a <a href="https://glossary.igorevans.com/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary.xhtml#physikon">natural</a> gloss: akin to silk though not slippery.
