<h2><a href="https://glossary.igorevans.com/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary.xhtml#gynaikeion"><i>gynaikeîon<br>gynaikeîa</i></a></h2><p>Literally, “female place”, referencing <i><a href="https://glossary.igorevans.com/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary.xhtml#gyne">gynḗ</a>. </i>In a proper house, it is the area in the rear or upstairs, specifically designated for women and their housework. This labor is largely concerned with the production and care of textiles and children. Children and female visitors have free access, and the men of the household may visit, while male visitors are strictly excluded. Modestly decorated, as befits the modest needs of modest women. As goes the <i><a href="https://glossary.igorevans.com/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary.xhtml#aphorismos">aphorismós</a>, </i>“a woman’s place is in the woman’s place”. Contrast with: <i><a href="https://glossary.igorevans.com/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary.xhtml#andron">andrṓn</a>.</i></p>
