<h2><a href="https://igorevansauthor.github.io/miklosglossary/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary.xhtml#mys"><i>mŷs<br>mŷes</i></a></h2><p>Mouse. Literally, “mouse” or “muscle”. A rodent of usual size, although the term refers also to the <a href="https://igorevansauthor.github.io/miklosglossary/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary.xhtml#tis">somewhat</a> <a href="https://igorevansauthor.github.io/miklosglossary/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary.xhtml#megas">larger</a>, scaly-tailed sort that is associated with the field: the ‹rat›. As a flexing muscle looks like a mouse scurrying under your skin, they share a name. The specific meaning is, of course, obvious in context. And though mice vary in size and strength, I would call <a href="https://igorevansauthor.github.io/miklosglossary/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary.xhtml#oudeis">none</a> of them mighty. No relation to ‹myco‑›, ‹Micky›, <i><a href="https://igorevansauthor.github.io/miklosglossary/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary.xhtml#mousikos">mousikós</a>. </i>Cognate of ‹mouse›, ‹muscle›, ‹murine›, ‹myo‑›; related to the cognates of ‹mussel›, ‹myocardium›. See also: <i><a href="https://igorevansauthor.github.io/miklosglossary/OEBPS/sections/section-glossary.xhtml#megalomyoxiphophoros">megalomyoxiphophóros</a>.</i></p>
